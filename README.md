## Introduction

**The Bottom Line:** The spiritual gifts continue in the church today under Scripture's authority. The canon is closed. Cessationism contradicts explicit biblical commands. And the vast majority of what parades as "charismatic" practice is unbiblical disorder that blasphemes the Spirit's name. This isn't a middle position—it's the only position the text permits.

---

## Setting the Table

Let's clarify upfront what this is and isn't about.

**First:** Affirming that miraculous gifts may have ceased as a normative church practice is not the same as denying God acts miraculously. God heals. He intervenes. He overrules natural law according to His sovereign will. The issue is whether the Spirit-distributed, Scripture-regulated gifts described in 1 Corinthians 12-14 continue as ordinary means of edification. That's the question.

**Second:** I am not a cessationist in the classical sense. As much as I would prefer to say "the Bible clearly teaches the gifts ended with the apostolic office," that would be an exegetical stretch. Honest engagement with the text demands I contend with what Scripture actually says. So I affirm that the spiritual gifts may continue—but only under the exacting boundaries Scripture lays out. If those boundaries are violated, what you're witnessing is not the Spirit's work but a counterfeit.

**Third:** I refuse to speculate on what genuine expressions might look like today. The question is not about observable phenomena but about a priori scriptural principles. The burden of proof is not on me to identify the authentic. It is on every practitioner to demonstrate their practice aligns with Scripture's rules. But rooting out fraud is straightforward: the Spirit and His gifts cannot act in opposition to God's established Word and order.

**Fourth:** If your entire Christian walk revolves around "experiencing" and "demonstrating" spiritual gifts, you have subordinated the Gospel to spectacle. You haven't preserved the gifts—you've idolized them, either directly or functionally.

With that groundwork laid, let's begin.

---

## Part One: Why Cessationism Fails

Let's be clear: cessationism often stems from noble motives. Many cessationists are concerned with protecting Scripture's unique authority, guarding against charismatic abuse, and maintaining doctrinal purity. These are legitimate concerns, and the charismatic movement has given them plenty of ammunition.

But good intentions don't validate bad exegesis. Cessationism fails not because it's cautious, but because it draws boundaries Scripture never draws. In attempting to protect the church from one form of error, it creates another: silencing what God has not silenced and prohibiting what Scripture commands.

### Scripture Commands What Cessationism Forbids

The New Testament contains clear, Spirit-inspired commands that remain binding on the church:

- "Earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy" (1 Cor. 14:1)
- "Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies" (1 Thess. 5:19-20)
- "Do not forbid speaking in tongues" (1 Cor. 14:39)

These are not suggestions. They are not culturally-bound practices for the first century. They are apostolic imperatives. Cessationism essentially responds: "Yes, Paul commanded this, but we've determined those commands no longer apply." 

On what basis? Where does Scripture revoke these commands? It doesn't. The burden of proof lies entirely with those claiming cessation, and they cannot meet it. You cannot point to a single text that says, "These gifts will cease when the apostles die" or "when the canon closes." The cessationist must import an interpretive grid—whether tied to Ephesians 2:20, Hebrews 1:1-2, or an appeal to "foundational" gifts—and then use that grid to override explicit commands. That's eisegesis, not exegesis.

If God commanded something and never revoked it, we are obligated to obey. To do otherwise is not prudence. It's presumption.

### The Standard Cessationist Arguments Don't Hold

Let's examine the texts cessationists typically cite.

**Ephesians 2:20 — "The Foundation" Argument**

Cessationists argue that "apostles and prophets" in Ephesians 2:20 represent a foundational, once-for-all office, and when that office ended, so did the gifts. But this confuses categories. The passage speaks of the unique, revelatory office of prophet tied to canonical authority—the foundation-layers who gave us Scripture itself. That office is unrepeatable.

But Scripture distinguishes between this foundational office and the ongoing gift of prophecy for edification. Paul describes prophecy's normal function as "upbuilding and encouragement and consolation" (1 Cor. 14:3). This isn't foundation-laying. It's house-building. Philip's four daughters prophesied (Acts 21:9), yet they wrote no Scripture and held no foundational office. Paul lists "prophets" among the gifts given "until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (Eph. 4:11-13).

Has the church reached that telos? No. We are still being sanctified, still maturing, still awaiting glorification. The foundation is laid once. The house is still being built. The gifts that build the house remain.

**1 Corinthians 13:8-10 — "The Perfect" and "Tongues Will Cease"**

Cessationists point to verse 8: "as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away." Then verse 10: "when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away." They claim "the perfect" refers to the completed canon, and therefore gifts have ceased.

But Paul defines what he means two verses later: seeing Christ "face to face" and knowing "fully, even as I have been fully known" (v. 12). That's glorification, not codification. The context is eschatological—when we see Christ at His return, our partial knowledge and prophetic utterances will be swallowed up in perfect knowledge.

We still "know in part." We still "see in a mirror dimly." The church has not attained the unity and maturity described in Ephesians 4:13. Until we do, the gifts that edify the church toward that end remain operative. Yes, tongues "will cease"—when Christ returns and we no longer need these partial means of edification. This isn't speculation—it's Paul's explicit framework.

**Hebrews 1:1-2 — "God Has Spoken" Argument**

Hebrews 1:1-2 contrasts fragmentary Old Covenant revelation ("at many times and in many ways") with definitive revelation in Christ ("in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son"). This is a Christological climax, not a chronological cutoff.

The point is not "God spoke then, but doesn't now." It's "God spoke partially then; He has now spoken finally and fully in the Son." The Son is the telos of redemptive revelation (Col. 1:19; John 1:18). But nowhere does Hebrews say this means the Spirit ceases to apply that revelation through gifts of exhortation, discernment, or edification.

In fact, the "last days" referenced here parallel Acts 2 and Joel 2—the very era in which the Spirit is poured out and gifts are distributed. If anything, Hebrews 1 establishes the Christ-centered hermeneutic for understanding revelation. It does not negate the Spirit's ongoing ministry of applying it.

**Hebrews 2:3-4 — "Signs and Wonders" Argument**

Some argue that signs and wonders were given exclusively to authenticate the apostles and the gospel message, and once that authentication was complete, they ceased. But this confuses the purpose of signs in confirming the gospel with the ongoing distribution of gifts for edification.

Yes, signs confirmed the message. But Scripture never restricts signs to the apostles. Stephen performed "great wonders and signs" (Acts 6:8). Philip did the same (Acts 8:6-7). Non-apostles exercised spiritual gifts throughout the New Testament, and Paul gives extended regulation for their continued use rather than instructions for their phase-out. 

Moreover, even if we distinguish between foundational sign-gifts (confirming new revelation) and edification gifts (applying established revelation), the cessationist case still fails. The gifts described in 1 Corinthians 12-14, Romans 12:6-8, and Ephesians 4:11-13 are not primarily authenticating signs—they are means of building up the body. Prophecy serves for "upbuilding and encouragement and consolation" (1 Cor. 14:3). These are not foundation-confirming functions; they are house-building functions. The cessationist must explain why clear commands about ongoing gift-use exist if those gifts were meant to vanish with the apostolic generation. They can't.

### The Timeframe Question

Paul ties the operation of gifts not to the death of the apostles or the closing of the canon, but to the church's arrival at maturity: "until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (Eph. 4:11-13).

That hasn't happened. The church is still fragmented, still growing, still being sanctified. We are living in the "last days"—the already/not yet epoch inaugurated by Christ's resurrection and awaiting His return (Acts 2:17; 1 John 2:18; Heb. 9:26). Peter, quoting Joel, declared that in these last days God would pour out His Spirit and "your sons and your daughters shall prophesy" (Acts 2:17-18). He continues: "For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself" (Acts 2:38-39). Nothing in Scripture limits that outpouring to the first century.

The evidence throughout Acts confirms this. Judas and Silas were prophets who "encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words" (Acts 15:32)—precisely the function Paul assigns to prophecy in 1 Corinthians 14:3. In Ephesus, when Paul laid hands on new disciples, "the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying" (Acts 19:6). Women prophesied in Corinth (1 Cor. 11:4-5), showing the gift was widespread and not restricted to apostles or church officers. Timothy received prophetic direction for his ministry (1 Tim. 1:18) and was given a spiritual gift "through prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you" (1 Tim. 4:14). This is not a picture of gifts vanishing—it's a picture of gifts functioning normally throughout the apostolic era and beyond.

Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12-14 give extensive instruction on gifts with no expiration date. Paul lists prophecy right alongside serving, teaching, and encouraging (Rom. 12:6-8)—treating it as a regular function of church life, not a temporary sign. The burden lies on cessationists to explain why these commands suddenly stopped applying without a single biblical word of revocation. Historical decline in gift-practice is not a biblical argument. It's evidence of ecclesial coldness, not divine cessation.

### The Consequences of Cessationism

Cessationism isn't just wrong—it's harmful. It quenches the Spirit's ordained means of edification. While claiming to protect against charismatic abuse, it fosters a different kind of abuse: a sterile formalism that can separate the Word from the Spirit who applies it, promote passive laity, and create lifeless ecclesiology. The Spirit is not merely a figure in historical theology—He is the active agent of sanctification, applying Christ's work through the means Christ appointed.

Cessationism also divides the body in a sectarian way. It casts suspicion on faithful, Word-submitted continuationist churches as if they are theologically compromised for simply obeying what the New Testament commands. It draws lines of fellowship where Scripture does not, treating the rejection of spiritual gifts as a test of orthodoxy when Scripture itself never does. This is sectarianism: elevating inference over instruction and excommunicating obedience under the guise of doctrinal precision.

Most importantly, **the biblical response to abuse is regulation, not cessation**. Paul addressed the chaos in Corinth not by denying the gifts but by governing them: "Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said" (1 Cor. 14:29). "All things should be done decently and in order" (1 Cor. 14:40). He commands: "Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies, but test everything; hold fast what is good" (1 Thess. 5:19-21). The solution to abuse is discernment, not denial. To abandon the gifts because of their misuse is to reject God's prescribed remedy. It's cutting off the hand because someone used it to steal.

Cessationism must be exposed, corrected, and repented of—not tolerated as a valid "position."

---

## Part Two: Why Charismatic Practice Fails

If cessationism silences what God has not revoked, modern charismatic practice does something worse: it blasphemes the Spirit by attributing to Him what He has not done.

### This Is Not a Secondary Issue

Before we go further, let's kill a common escape route. The claim that charismatic theology is "secondary" or "non-essential" is doctrinal minimalism dressed as humility. It's an attempt to detach obedience from regeneration.

If you are truly born of God, your affections are for Christ, and your obedience flows from grace—not as a condition of justification but as its fruit. You do not get to blaspheme the Holy Spirit, attribute fleshly indulgence to His name, preach a false gospel, and then claim entrance into glory on the basis of a bare profession.

Christ warns: "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness'" (Matt. 7:21-23).

Obedience is not legalism when it is the fruit of saving grace. And disobedience in the Spirit's name is not a minor issue when it distorts the gospel and leads people into deception.

### Even If the Gifts Ceased, These Practices Still Fail

Here's a critical point: **even if we grant the cessationist premise that gifts have ceased, the modern charismatic manifestations still fail every biblical test**. This isn't just about whether gifts continue. It's about whether what's being practiced aligns with Scripture at all.

Let's examine the evidence.

### Prophecy: Redefined Into Irrelevance

Old Testament prophecy operated under the Deuteronomy 18 standard: absolute accuracy or death (Deut. 18:20-22). The prophet spoke the very words of God, and if those words failed, the prophet was false.

New Testament prophecy functions differently. It is Spirit-prompted but not infallible, which is why it must be tested and weighed (1 Cor. 14:29). Consider Agabus, who prophesied that Paul would be bound by the Jews and handed over to the Gentiles (Acts 21:11). Yet when events unfolded, it was the Romans who bound Paul—to protect him from the Jews (Acts 21:33). The essence was correct; the details were not. Under an Old Covenant standard, Agabus would be marked false. 

Yet notice: **Luke records this without any apostolic correction, rebuke, or judgment**. No one applies the Deuteronomy 18 death penalty. No one questions Agabus's legitimacy as a prophet—in fact, earlier in Acts, his prophecy about a famine was accurate and prompted the church to send relief (Acts 11:27-28). The apostles' response—or rather, their *lack* of response—demonstrates that New Testament prophecy operates under a different protocol. The Spirit is never inaccurate, but He speaks through fallible people. Like a perfect beam of light refracting through a cracked lens, the message is true in essence, but the articulation may contain human imprecision. That's why NT prophecy must be tested, not automatically received.

Paul's instructions confirm this. Prophecy is to be judged (1 Cor. 14:29). It is interruptible (v. 30). It is widely distributed, not restricted to an office (v. 31). Crucially, Paul distinguishes his own apostolic writings as "the Lord's command" (v. 37), setting them in a category far above the prophetic utterances he encourages.

The New Testament creates the category: Spirit-prompted, edifying speech that serves the body without claiming canonical authority. It's like preaching. A faithful sermon may bring conviction and timely insight, yet no one claims it belongs in the canon. Similarly, a Spirit-prompted exhortation may serve meaningfully without threatening sola Scriptura.

**But modern charismatic "prophecy" fails even this lower standard.** It is vague ("I sense God saying..."), manipulative, unaccountable, and often flatly wrong. Consider the verifiable track record: prophecies that COVID-19 would end by specific dates—unfulfilled. Prophecies about election outcomes—wrong. Prophecies about personal breakthroughs, financial windfalls, and divine appointments—rarely tested, never verified, always forgotten when they fail.

If prophecy is real, it must be specific, testable, and aligned with Scripture. If it fails, it is false or wrongly attributed to the Spirit. There is no third category for "close enough" or "I felt something." And when someone's prophetic "word" fails, they don't face accountability—they just move on to the next impression. This isn't prophecy. It's spiritual speculation dressed in religious language.

### Tongues: Corrupted Beyond Recognition

Biblical tongues were real, intelligible foreign languages spoken by the Spirit for evangelistic clarity (Acts 2:4-11). The crowd at Pentecost heard the apostles declaring "the mighty works of God" in their own native languages. This was a miraculous reversal of Babel—scattered nations hearing the gospel in their own tongues.

Paul regulates tongues carefully. They must be interpreted (1 Cor. 14:27-28). Only two or three should speak, and in turn. If no interpreter is present, the speaker must remain silent. The mind must be engaged, not bypassed (1 Cor. 14:14-15). Tongues are for a sign to unbelievers, not for private ecstasy (v. 22).

Modern charismatic tongues violate every one of these principles. They are uninterpreted. They occur simultaneously. They produce confusion rather than clarity. If this is a "heavenly language," why are no sermons, commentaries, or theological works composed in it? Why does interpretation never occur in any verifiable, consistent way?

The answer is straightforward: what is being practiced does not align with Scripture's description or regulation.

### Disorder: Chaos Dressed as Worship

"God is not a God of confusion but of peace" (1 Cor. 14:33). "All things should be done decently and in order" (1 Cor. 14:40). The fruit of the Spirit includes self-control (Gal. 5:22-23)—not uncontrolled convulsing, shrieking, or staggering around as if intoxicated.

"Holy laughter"? Being "slain in the Spirit"? "Drunk in the Spirit"? These are not biblical categories. They mirror the ecstatic, frenzied practices of pagan worship—not the ordered, reverent worship Scripture prescribes.

True worship is "in spirit and truth" (John 4:24). It magnifies Christ, not human experience. It is intelligible, edifying, and governed by the Word. When the "spirit" on display produces chaos, self-exaltation, and emotionalism devoid of truth, it is not the Holy Spirit. It is another spirit (2 Cor. 11:4).

The manipulation is often explicit. If you don't feel something, you're told your faith is weak. If you're not "experiencing" the Spirit, something must be wrong with you. This is emotional coercion, not biblical ministry. It preys on people's desire for spiritual authenticity and turns it into a test of their standing before God.

Jesus warned a sign-seeking generation: "An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah" (Matt. 12:39). The obsession with signs, wonders, and experiences as validation reveals a heart that does not rest in the sufficiency of Christ and the finished gospel. The greatest miracle is regeneration. The most powerful sign is a transformed life. Everything else is spectacle.

### The Burden of Proof Remains

The Spirit distributes gifts for the building up of the body, not for personal ecstasy or spectacle (1 Cor. 12:7, 11). Prophecy must be specific, testable, and aligned with Scripture—otherwise it is false or falsely attributed. Tongues must be interpreted and orderly—otherwise they are forbidden. Any church that prioritizes experiences over doctrine has already departed from biblical Christianity.

Christians are commanded to "test the spirits" (1 John 4:1), not to passively tolerate abuse in the Spirit's name. What is happening in much of the charismatic world is not a continuation of biblical gifts. It is their corruption. Worse, it blasphemes God by associating His name with error, disorder, and human pride.

The Spirit sanctifies. He convicts. He glorifies Christ, not man. If the "spirit" on display fails these tests, it is not the Holy Spirit.

### The False Gospel of the "Second Baptism"

The doctrine of a "second baptism of the Spirit" has no exegetical foundation. Scripture knows only one baptism into Christ by the Spirit (Eph. 4:5; 1 Cor. 12:13).

When Jesus spoke of being "born of water and the Spirit" (John 3:5), He was not describing a two-stage process. He was referencing Ezekiel 36:25-27, where God promises to cleanse His people (water) and give them a new heart and Spirit. This is a single, sovereign act of regeneration—not an initial salvation followed by a secondary "filling."

Paul separates water baptism from justification repeatedly (1 Cor. 1:14-17; Gal. 2:16). Water baptism is the covenant sign—like circumcision under the old administration (Col. 2:11-12)—not the instrument of salvation. The gospel call is to repentance and faith (Mark 1:15), not repentance plus a secondary experience marked by tongues.

To require a "second baptism" for full salvation or Spirit-fullness is to add to the gospel. It renders the thief on the cross unregenerate—he spoke no tongues, received no water baptism, yet Christ assured him, "Today you will be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:43).

This is not a secondary issue. It is another gospel (Gal. 1:8-9), and those who preach it stand under apostolic anathema.

---

## Part Three: The Biblical Standard

Both cessationism and charismatic excess must be rejected. The way forward is strict continuationism: the gifts continue, and they must be regulated.

### Canon and Charisma Are Not the Same

The canon is closed. Scripture is "breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness" (2 Tim. 3:16-17). God has spoken definitively in Christ (Heb. 1:1-2). The faith has been "once for all delivered to the saints" (Jude 3). If anyone adds to Scripture, they are under divine judgment (Rev. 22:18-19).

Any claim to new revelation that adds to, contradicts, or supplants Scripture is false. That is not what continuationism affirms.

Charismatic revelation is situational, non-canonical, and fallible. It must be tested against Scripture (1 Thess. 5:21). It serves the body in specific moments for edification, not for doctrinal foundation. Just as a faithful sermon may bring conviction without being canonical, so a Spirit-prompted exhortation may serve the body without threatening sola Scriptura.

The two are not in tension. They are symphonic. The Spirit does not contradict Scripture—He applies it. Gifts function under the Word's authority to build up the church, never to bypass or replace it. That is why Paul gives extensive regulation for their use (1 Cor. 14). Misuse must be rebuked. But rightful use must not be rejected. The two are not in tension—they are symphonic, each serving the glory of Christ and the edification of His body under the governance of His revealed Word.

### We Are Still in the "Last Days"

The telos has not arrived. The church has not attained the unity, maturity, and fullness of Christ described in Ephesians 4:13. We are still living in the "last days"—the epoch inaugurated by Christ's resurrection and awaiting His return (Acts 2:17; 1 John 2:18). During this time, the Spirit continues to equip the church through the means Christ appointed: His Word, His ordinances, and His gifts.

To claim otherwise is to place tradition above text and inference above instruction.

### The Presence of Counterfeits Does Not Invalidate the Genuine

False prophecy exists because real prophecy exists. Counterfeits only appear where there is something real to counterfeit. The solution to abuse is not abandonment—it is discernment.

We test the spirits (1 John 4:1). We hold fast what is good (1 Thess. 5:21). We reject what fails the test. Scripture warns repeatedly about false teachers who will arise with destructive heresies (Titus 1:9-11; 2 Peter 2:1-3). The response is not to abandon Spirit-empowered ministry but to guard the truth and exercise biblical judgment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What about church history? Most Reformed theologians were cessationists.

Church history is instructive but not authoritative. Scripture alone is our final court of appeal. Yes, many respected Reformed theologians held cessationist positions—Calvin, Owen, Spurgeon, Warfield, and others whose contributions to the church we rightly honor. But they also held positions on baptism, ecclesiology, and eschatology that many of us disagree with based on Scripture. Historical consensus doesn't settle exegetical questions, and it never has.

The appeal to tradition often functions as an escape hatch to avoid dealing with the biblical texts directly. When someone says, "But the Reformed tradition teaches cessationism," what they're really saying is, "I don't want to wrestle with 1 Corinthians 14:1, 39 or 1 Thessalonians 5:19-20." That's not exegesis. That's deference to a secondary authority.

We honor the insights of those who came before us. We learn from their wisdom. But we don't grant them the final word where Scripture speaks clearly. If we did, we'd still be practicing infant baptism, holding to a particular view of church government, or accepting their interpretations on a host of other issues. The Reformers themselves insisted on *sola Scriptura*—Scripture alone. We dishonor them when we elevate their conclusions above the text they fought to make supreme.

Historical decline in the practice of spiritual gifts is real, but it's not a biblical argument. It's evidence of ecclesial coldness, theological laziness, or reaction to abuse—not proof of divine cessation. The church has also experienced periods of decline in evangelism, missions, and doctrinal clarity. We don't conclude that these things ceased; we recognize we need reformation.

### 2. Most self-identified continuationists are functionally charismatic. Aren't you just giving them cover?

No. I'm not defending what exists—I'm arguing for what Scripture teaches. The fact that most who claim continuationism practice charismatic excess doesn't invalidate the biblical position any more than antinomianism invalidates grace or hyper-Calvinism invalidates the doctrines of sovereignty.

The solution to abuse is not the opposite error, but biblical faithfulness. Strict continuationism rejects both cessationism AND charismatic practice. Most who call themselves continuationists need to repent of their disorder, emotionalism, and false prophecy just as much as cessationists need to repent of quenching the Spirit and despising prophecies.

I'm not providing cover for the charismatic movement. I'm exposing it. The entire second part of this article is devoted to showing why charismatic practice fails every biblical test. But I won't commit the opposite error of cessationism just because charismatics have made a mess of things. Two wrongs don't make a right.

What we need is not a retreat into cessationism, but a return to Scripture. We need churches that obey *all* of God's commands—including the ones about spiritual gifts—while maintaining the order, discernment, and Word-centeredness that Scripture also requires. That's not what most continuationists are doing. But it's what we *should* be doing.

### 3. If gifts continue, why don't we see apostolic-level miracles today?

This question conflates categories, and it's a category error that needs to be corrected.

The apostles had unique sign-gifts that authenticated their role as foundation-layers and bearers of new revelation. Paul calls these "the signs of a true apostle" (2 Cor. 12:12). They confirmed the gospel message in the foundational era (Heb. 2:3-4). These gifts were tied to a unique office that has ceased. We affirm this. The apostolic office—with its authority to write Scripture, lay doctrinal foundations, and perform extraordinary signs—does not continue.

But not all gifts were apostolic signs. The gifts described in 1 Corinthians 12-14, Romans 12:6-8, and Ephesians 4:11-13 are for the ordinary edification of the body, not for authenticating new revelation. Even in the apostolic era, not everyone raised the dead, healed the sick, or cast out demons. But many prophesied, encouraged, taught, served, and contributed to the body through Spirit-given abilities.

Paul makes this distinction clear. When he lists spiritual gifts, he includes prophecy, teaching, serving, encouraging, giving, and leading (Rom. 12:6-8). These are not spectacular signs; they're means of building up the church. The absence of apostolic-level signs doesn't prove all gifts have ceased—it proves the apostolic office has ceased, which we affirm.

Moreover, even healing and miracles, when they occurred in the New Testament, were not always spectacular or apostle-exclusive. Philip performed signs (Acts 8:6-7). Stephen did as well (Acts 6:8). And many in the Corinthian church had gifts of healing (1 Cor. 12:9, 28). These weren't apostles, yet they exercised gifts for the building up of the body.

The real question isn't "Why don't we see apostolic signs?" but "Are we obeying the commands about the gifts Scripture does describe?" And the answer, for both cessationists and charismatics, is largely no.

### 4. Why are cessationist churches often more doctrinally sound than charismatic ones?

Because cessationism, while exegetically wrong, at least prioritizes Scripture and doctrinal precision. Cessationist churches tend to emphasize expositional preaching, biblical literacy, theological depth, and doctrinal accountability. These are good and necessary things.

Charismatic theology, by contrast, often prioritizes experience over exegesis. It fosters an environment where feelings, impressions, and subjective encounters are valued more than careful biblical interpretation. This leads to theological shallowness, susceptibility to error, and a revolving door of fads and movements. The track record speaks for itself.

But this is a pragmatic observation, not a theological argument. The fact that error produces bad fruit doesn't mean the opposite position is automatically correct. It's entirely possible for a church to be wrong on cessationism and still be far healthier than a charismatic church—because they're getting other, more foundational things right.

Biblical continuationism should produce both doctrinal fidelity AND Spirit-empowered ministry—because both flow from submission to Scripture's full teaching. A church that obeys all of Scripture—including its commands about gifts—while maintaining rigorous biblical standards will be healthier than either a cessationist church that ignores clear commands or a charismatic church that ignores clear regulations.

The problem is that such churches are rare. But rarity doesn't disprove the biblical position. It proves we need reformation.

### 5. Doesn't this position lead to confusion about Scripture's authority?

Only if you confuse canon with charisma. And that confusion is precisely what charismatics create and what cessationists rightly fear. But the solution is not to deny what Scripture teaches—it's to maintain the distinction Scripture itself makes.

The canon is closed, infallible, and universal (Jude 3; Rev. 22:18-19). It is the final, sufficient revelation of God for faith and practice (2 Tim. 3:16-17). Nothing can be added to it. Nothing can replace it. No prophetic word, no impression, no vision carries the authority of Scripture.

Charismatic gifts, on the other hand, are situational, fallible, and must be tested against Scripture (1 Thess. 5:21). They don't add to the canon. They don't provide new doctrine. They don't carry the same authority as apostolic revelation. They serve the body in specific moments under the governance of the Word.

A Spirit-prompted word of encouragement no more threatens sola Scriptura than a faithful sermon does. Both are means by which God applies His truth to His people. Both are under Scripture's authority. Neither adds to it.

The confusion comes when people—especially charismatics—fail to maintain this distinction. When they treat impressions as infallible. When they say "God told me" and expect the same submission as if they were quoting Scripture. When they elevate experience above the text. That's the problem. And that's why their theology must be rejected.

But we don't protect Scripture's authority by denying what Scripture itself teaches. We protect it by maintaining Scripture's supremacy over all charismatic claims and requiring that everything be tested.

### 6. If gifts exist, shouldn't they be common? Why are genuine examples so rare?

The rarity of genuine gifts doesn't prove cessationism—it proves most claims are false. And Scripture prepares us for this.

Even in the New Testament, gifts were distributed "as the Spirit wills" (1 Cor. 12:11), not universally or constantly. Not everyone prophesied. Not everyone spoke in tongues. Not everyone healed. The Spirit gave gifts variously and according to His sovereign purpose. Paul's extended instructions in 1 Corinthians 12-14 exist precisely because gifts could be counterfeited, misused, or falsely claimed.

Moreover, Scripture warns repeatedly about false prophets, false teachers, and those who would abuse the things of God (Matt. 7:15; 2 Peter 2:1; 1 John 4:1). The presence of widespread fraud doesn't disprove the existence of the genuine. It confirms what Scripture predicts: that discernment is necessary, testing is required, and most claims will fail.

A true gift of prophecy for edification might be rare in a given congregation or era. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It means the Spirit distributes as He wills, not as we demand. And it means the burden remains on practitioners to demonstrate biblical fidelity, not on critics to find the needle in the charismatic haystack.

Rarity is not the same as cessation. It's evidence of the Spirit's sovereignty and the church's need for discernment.

## Practical Guidance for Pastors and Elders

### Guarding the Gates

Elders are responsible for protecting the flock from false teaching and disorder (Acts 20:28-31; Titus 1:9). This means you must be vigilant, discerning, and uncompromising when it comes to what is taught and practiced in your church. Your responsibility is not to facilitate every claimed spiritual experience, but to guard the sheep from wolves—even when those wolves come dressed in spiritual language.

**Test everything.** Do not permit any claimed "word from the Lord" to go untested. Require specificity, biblical alignment, and accountability. If someone says "God told me," ask them what specifically God said, how it aligns with Scripture, and what the consequences are if it proves false. Vague impressions are not prophecy. "I sense God is saying" is not a prophetic word. It's speculation. Don't allow it to be presented as anything more.

**Maintain order.** Follow Paul's regulations in 1 Corinthians 14 to the letter. If someone claims to prophesy, require them to speak one at a time, limit the number who speak in a given gathering, and ensure that others weigh what is said (vv. 29-33). If someone speaks in what they claim is a tongue, require interpretation. If there is no interpreter, require silence (vv. 27-28). If these regulations are violated, shut it down immediately. Disorder is not from the Spirit, and you have biblical authority to stop it.

**Protect Scripture's unique authority.** Never allow any "prophetic word" to be treated as equal to or independent from Scripture. Everything must be tested against the Word. If it contradicts Scripture, reject it immediately. If it adds to Scripture, reject it. If it qualifies or reinterprets Scripture based on subjective experience, reject it. The Word is supreme, and no claimed revelation stands on equal footing.

**Discipline those who persist in false prophecy.** If someone repeatedly offers words that fail the test, or refuses to submit their words to examination, they are not operating in the Spirit. They must be corrected. If they persist, they must be removed from any teaching or leadership role. False prophecy is serious, and the damage it does to the body is real. Protect the flock.

### Teaching the Distinction

Most people in your congregation have been shaped either by cessationism or charismatic excess. Very few have been taught the biblical categories clearly. Your job is to correct both errors by teaching what Scripture actually says.

**Canon vs. Charisma.** Teach your people that the canon is closed. It is complete, sufficient, and final. Any claim to add to Scripture is false and must be rejected. But also teach them that non-canonical, Spirit-prompted encouragement that aligns with Scripture is not a threat—it's a means of grace, just like a sermon. The two are not in competition. One is the rule; the other operates under that rule.

**Office vs. Gift.** Teach your people that the apostolic office has ceased. The apostles were unique foundation-layers who wrote Scripture and authenticated the gospel with extraordinary signs. That office is unrepeatable. But the gift of prophecy for edification—described in 1 Corinthians 14:3 as "upbuilding and encouragement and consolation"—has not ceased. These are different categories that Scripture itself distinguishes. Don't confuse them.

**Sign vs. Edification.** Teach your people that miraculous signs authenticated new revelation in the foundational era. We don't expect those signs today because the foundation has been laid. But edifying gifts—prophecy, teaching, encouragement, service—build up the body. We don't expect the former; we regulate the latter.

Regularly preach through 1 Corinthians 12-14. Teach your people what the gifts are, how they function, and how they are to be tested. Teach them to test, not to quench. Teach them to discern, not to despise. And teach them that obedience includes both rejecting what is false and pursuing what Scripture commands.

### Creating a Culture of Discernment

Do not create a culture where people feel pressured to "experience" gifts or where every claimed manifestation goes unchallenged. But also don't create a culture where people are afraid to acknowledge the Spirit's work or where any mention of gifts is met with suspicion. Both extremes are wrong. Instead, create a culture of sober-minded, biblical discernment.

**Emphasize the ordinary means of grace.** Teach your people that the Word preached, the sacraments administered, faithful prayer, and fellowship in the body are the Spirit's regular instruments. These are not lesser means. They are the primary means by which God builds His church. Gifts, if genuine, serve these means; they don't replace them. A church that neglects preaching, prayer, and the sacraments in favor of chasing experiences has already departed from biblical Christianity.

**Avoid either extreme.** Don't foster cessationist suspicion where people are afraid to speak of the Spirit's work, where spontaneous prayer is viewed with skepticism, or where any claim to spiritual insight is immediately dismissed. That's not discernment—it's quenching. But don't foster charismatic enthusiasm where every feeling is treated as divine, where order is sacrificed for spontaneity, or where experience trumps Scripture. That's not freedom—it's chaos. Teach sober-minded discernment rooted in Scripture.

**Model it yourself.** When you preach, explain your exegesis. Show your people how you arrived at your conclusions from the text. When you pray, be intelligible and edifying. When you lead, be orderly and purposeful. Show your people what Spirit-filled, Word-governed ministry looks like. They need to see it, not just hear about it.

### When You Encounter Claims

If someone in your church claims a prophetic word, a tongue, or another manifestation of a spiritual gift, here's how to handle it:

1. **Ask for clarity.** What specifically are they claiming? If it's vague or unclear, it's not prophecy. Require them to articulate exactly what they believe the Spirit is saying. If they can't, dismiss it.

2. **Test against Scripture.** Does it align with biblical teaching? Does it edify the body? Is it presented in an orderly way? If it contradicts Scripture, qualifies Scripture, or adds to Scripture, reject it immediately. If it doesn't edify, it's not from the Spirit (1 Cor. 14:26). If it's chaotic, it's not from God (1 Cor. 14:33).

3. **Require accountability.** If it's a prediction or directive, hold them to it. Write it down. Follow up. If it proves false, address it. False words require correction, and those who give them need to know there are consequences. Don't let failed prophecies slide. That's how charlatans operate.

4. **Evaluate the fruit.** Does this person display the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23)? Are they humble, teachable, and submissive to Scripture? Do they accept correction graciously? Or are they self-promoting, resistant to oversight, and quick to claim special insight? The fruit will tell you what you need to know.

5. **Don't be hasty.** Don't immediately affirm or deny. Test. Weigh. Consult with other elders. Pray for wisdom. "Hold fast what is good" (1 Thess. 5:21). If something passes all the biblical tests, affirm it cautiously. If it doesn't, reject it clearly. If you can't determine either way, withhold judgment but remain vigilant.

If after testing you determine a claim is not genuine, say so clearly and charitably. Explain why it fails the biblical test and what would need to be different. If you cannot determine either way, be honest about that too. And if someone proves to be a repeat offender—offering words that consistently fail—discipline them. Remove them from any teaching or leadership capacity. Protect the flock.

### The Bottom Line for Church Leaders

Your job is not to manufacture spiritual experiences. It is to teach Scripture faithfully, maintain biblical order, and protect the flock from error. If the Spirit distributes gifts, He will do so according to His will and under the Word's authority. Your task is to create an environment where the Word is supreme, order is maintained, and both quenching and chaos are avoided.

Pursue biblical fidelity above all. Don't chase experiences. Don't manufacture moments. Don't pressure people to perform. Instead, teach Scripture, model godliness, maintain order, and trust that the Spirit who inspired Scripture will honor its authority.

The Spirit doesn't need your help to do His work. He needs your obedience. Obey what Scripture commands. Reject what Scripture forbids. Test what Scripture requires testing. And build a church that submits fully to God's Word, not to tradition, not to experience, and not to the latest fad.

That's your calling. Fulfill it faithfully.

## Conclusion

Cessationism is sectarian. It draws lines God did not draw and silences what He has not revoked. It elevates tradition and inference over the explicit commands of Scripture, and it divides the body over issues where Scripture gives clear instruction.

Charismatic excess is blasphemous. It attributes to the Spirit what He has not done, leads people into deception under the guise of spiritual experience, and makes a mockery of biblical order and truth. It subordinates the Gospel to spectacle and Christ to emotionalism.

Strict continuationism is the only position that submits fully to Scripture. The gifts are real. The abuses are rampant. The solution is not retreat—it's reformation. Scripture governs all: our experience does not, our traditions do not, and our fear of disorder does not.

**Test everything. Hold fast what is good. Do not quench the Spirit.**

This is not preference. This is not tradition. This is obedience.
